            The goal is to line up the house at the origin with the grayscale target house by using basic transformations: 
            translating, rotating, and scaling.

              Introduction to Computer Graphics: Transforms
            </a>
            : Professor David J. Eck published a free online textbook about computer graphics, and this section on transformations
            is a great introduction to the basic transformations as well as their uses in the context of graphics.
