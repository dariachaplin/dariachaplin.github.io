          <p>This tool is based on 
            <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/exploratory/freeSoftware/repository/edu/brown/cs/exploratories/applets/transformationGame/transformation_game_guide.html">
              Brown University's Transformation Game</a>, an applet created to demonstrate how 2D transformations are 
              chained together.</p>
          <p>The goal is to line up the house at the origin with the grayscale target house by using basic transformations: 
            translating, rotating, and scaling.</p>
          <p>Below, you'll see the current sequence of transforms displayed and some buttons to add new ones. Keep in mind how 
            operations are applied: if you want to rotate and then translate a point, you'll need to multiply the translation 
            matrix by the rotation matrix by the point's coordinates.</p>
          <p>Each time you select a button to add a transform, it will be placed on the leftmost side of the multiplication 
            sequence, and it will also appear at the bottom of the input rows. You can delete a transform by clicking the "X" 
            button on its input row.</p>
          <p>Modify the transforms and their values until your house matches up with the goal and a star appears. Try the later 
            levels for more of a challenge, or see the other tabs to create your own levels!</p>

          <p>On this tab, you can use similar selection methods to the game to create your own level. Enter a level 
            name and as many transforms as desired. The sequence of transforms you create will set up where the target 
            house is on the resulting level. Feel free to switch to the 'Instructions' tab and try out your 
            transforms there to double check that the result matches your goal.</p>
          <p>Note that if a level exists with the same name, it will be overwritten.</p>
