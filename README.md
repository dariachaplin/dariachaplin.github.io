# RIT MS Capstone Project
### Author: Daria Chaplin

## Description
Many existing interactive pedagogical aids for computer graphics concepts at RIT are deprecated or otherwise inaccessible. Those that do still work often are difficult to use or struggle to guide the user to an understanding.
This project seeks to address this by creating an extendable framework for pedagogical aids. Using the Processing Foundation's p5.js library, I have reimagined several existing tools and structured the code to be easily extended for the future creation of more.
The three tools I have set up (and links to their original versions) are for:
- Color space conversion (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ncs/color/a_spaces.html)
- The polygon fill algorithm (https://www.cs.rit.edu/~icss571/filling/example.html)
- Chaining 2D transformations (http://cs.brown.edu/exploratory/freeSoftware/repository/edu/brown/cs/exploratories/applets/transformationGame/transformation_game_guide.html).
