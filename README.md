# RIT MS Capstone Project - In Progress
### Author: Daria Chaplin
### Advised by: Professor Reynold Bailey

## Description
### Many existing interactive pedagogical aids for computer graphics concepts at RIT are deprecated or otherwise inaccessible. Those that do still work often are difficult to use or struggle to guide the user to an understanding.
### This project seeks to address this by creating an extendable framework for pedagogical aids. Using the Processing Foundation's p5.js library, I will reimagine several existing tools and structure the code to be easily extended for the future creation of more.
### As the project progresses, I will update this description to include details for each aid as well as instructions for users to make their own.
